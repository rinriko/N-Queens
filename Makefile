# Signifies our desired python version
# Makefile macros (or variables) are defined a little bit differently than traditional bash, keep in mind that in the Makefile there's top-level Makefile-only syntax, and everything else is bash script syntax.
PYTHON = python3

# .PHONY defines parts of the makefile that are not dependant on any specific file
# This is most often used to store functions
.PHONY = help setup install

# Defines the default target that `make` will to try to make, or in the case of a phony target, execute the specified commands
# This target is executed whenever we just type `make`
.DEFAULT_GOAL = help

# The @ makes sure that the command itself isn't echoed in the terminal
help:
	@echo "---------------HELP-----------------"
	@echo "To setup the project type 'make setup'"
	@echo "To run the project type 'make run'"
	@echo "------------------------------------"

run:
	${PYTHON} ui.py

setup:
	${PYTHON} -m pip install -r requirements.txt
